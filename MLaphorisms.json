"quote":"what would quantum blockchains look like? isnâ€™t that
if quantum computing is rather a mindset overlaid on entangled probabilities (gleick, the information - chapter 13(?)) and blockchains are commoditized (immutable) trust, than can quantum blockchains be abstracted to social capital, which can arguably be interchanged with love/trust?
blockchain = commoditized trust
quantum = mindset of entangled probabilities",

"quote":"tl;dr - Assessing other programmers in general is hard; assessing ourselves is harder. This creates a situation where the competent can't be entirely sure of themselves and the incompetent can misjudge others. This can lead to situations of social disapproval even for competent or excellent programmers.
 The author hypothesizes that women have less tolerance for social disapproval and therefore are more likely to avoid programming as a career.
d/dx(tl;dr) - Programmers can be assholes to each other. Maybe women don't dig that so much?"
