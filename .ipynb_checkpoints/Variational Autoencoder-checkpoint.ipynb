    "A development in unsupervised machine learning that combines probabilistic Bayesian inference with deep learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional autoencoders models (usually multilayer ANNs) designed to output reconstruction of input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Representation learning --> the model learns own definition of 'meaningful' representation based only on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many deep learning systems in production today rely on expensive-to-obtain labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though trained holistically, autoencoders often built for part instead of whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "VAEs incorp regularization by explicitely learning joint distribution over data and a set of latent variables that is most compatibe with observed datapoints and some designated prior distribution over latent space.\n",

    "### VAE Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "A vanilla autoencoder is deterministic, a variational autoencoder is stochastic.\n",
